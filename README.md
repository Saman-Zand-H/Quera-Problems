# Quera-Problems
a repository for solutions to Python/Django problems on Quera.org

Each folder has a readme file that provides the actual problem and what we are asked to do.

Also I am open to review other solutions for different problems. Send me merge requests. You can help me gather as many solutions as possible for other developers. 

Have a good journey =).
